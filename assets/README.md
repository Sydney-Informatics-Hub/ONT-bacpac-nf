# `assets/` 

You can store auxillary files that your workflow may bed in here. We don't recommend storing data in your git repository but if you had a samplesheet you'd like to use for automated testing then it could be placed here. Additionally, you may wish to store the following: 

* [Multiqc config yaml]() files 
* Logo image files 
* Email templates (e.g. nf-core/sarek email [.txt](https://github.com/nf-core/sarek/blob/master/assets/email_template.txt) and [.html](https://github.com/nf-core/sarek/blob/master/assets/email_template.html)) 
* [Parameter json schema](https://nextflow-io.github.io/nf-schema/latest/nextflow_schema/nextflow_schema_specification/#required-parameters)
